/**
 * Class for testing if rewriting works at the tested location.
 *
 * The tester reports success when:
 * - a rewrite is proven to be working
 *
 * The tester reports failure when:
 * - Server does not have mod_rewrite installed
 * - Server is set up to ignore .htaccess files in the directory
 * - Server disallows any the following directives in the directory: RewriteEngine, Rewrite, IfModule
 *     (if disallowed, the result is either a 500 Internal Server Error or that the directive is
 *     ignored, depending on whether Nonfatal is set)
 * - The request results in a 500 Internal Server Error due to another problem than a disallowed
 *     directive (this is a false negative)
 *
 * The test works by creating an .htaccess which redirects requests to "0.txt"
 * to "1.txt" and then requesting "0.txt".
 *
 * Notes:
 * - The test might result in the following being written to the error log:
 *      "RewriteEngine not allowed here"
 * - We are not redirecting to a php, because that would additionally require phps
 *      to be run in that directory
 * - We are wrapping the .htaccess directives in a "<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>" and therefore this test
 *      also relies on the IfModule directive being allowed. It probably usually is, as it is harmless.
 *      Also, it is good practice to use it, so in most cases it is good that this is checked
 *      too. Actually, the <IfModule> wrap isn't neccessary for our test to work, as the test
 *      identifies a 500 Internal Error as test failure. However, not having the wrap would
 *      cause the test to generate an entry in the error log when mod_rewrite isn't installed
 *      (regardless if overrides are configured to Nonfatal or not):
 *      "Invalid command 'RewriteEngine', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included
 *      in the server configuration"

/**
 * Class for testing if a .htaccess results in a 500 Internal Server Error
 * (ie due to being malformed or containing directives that are unknown or not allowed)
 *
 * The tester reports success when:
 * - A request to a certain file in the directory does not result in a 500 Internal Server Error
 *
 * The tester reports failure when:
 * - A request to a certain file in the directory results in a 500 Internal Server Error
 *
 * The tester reports indeterminate (null) when:
 * - get_headers() call fails (What kind of failure could this be, I wonder?)
 *
 * Notes:
 * - There might be false negatives, as there could be other reasons behind a 501 error than
 *       than a malformed .htaccess.
 * - The tester only reports failure on a 500 Internal Server Error. All other status codes (even server errors)
 *       are treated as a success. The assumption here is that malformed .htaccess files / .htaccess
 *       files containing unknown or disallowed directives always results in a 500
 * - If your purpose is to test if a request succeeds (response 200 Ok), you should create your own class.
 *       (note that if you want to ensure that a php will succeed, make sure that a php is requested)

 * Class for testing if granting access works (doesn't result in a 500 Internal Server Error).
 *
 * It is not uncommon to see .htaccess files that are put in a folder in order
 * to override access restrictions that possible have been added to a parent
 * .htaccess files by ie a security plugin.
 * However, such practise can lead to problems because some some servers may
 * have been configured to not allow access configurations in .htaccess files.
 * If that is the case, the result is a 500 Internal Server Error.
